## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a cybersecurity professional with a focus on **Security Operations (SOC)** and defensive strategies.  
I build hands-on labs that mirror enterprise SOC environments, analyze real-world threats, and work with tools like **Wazuh, Security Onion, ELK, and Splunk**.

I’m passionate about transforming raw alerts into actionable insights and defending systems against adversarial activity.
